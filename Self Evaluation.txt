To Solve the problem of Huffman Tree
First Create a leaf node for each unique character and build a min heap of all leaf nodes 
Then compare two heap nodes Prints huffman codes from the root of Huffman Tree.
Iterate while size of heap doesn't become one
Extract the two minimum freq items from min heap
Create a new internal node with frequency equal to the sum of the two nodes frequencies. 
Make the two extracted node as left and right children of this new node. 
Keep reapeating this process until the heap contains only one node.
The remaining node is the root node and the tree is complete.
